						<h3>Typography Poster</h3>
						<p>For this project, our class was tasked to make a custom typeface using the letters of the alphabet. Everyone created their own set of characters. I designed the letters “U”, “Z” and the number “7.” Using the characters, the class built a variety of posters to show off the typeface, while demonstrating our design skills. The class had agreed on naming the typeface “OHKY.”</p>

						<h3>Thesis - Educational Math App</h3>
						<p>As my thesis project, I researched how to design an educational math application for kids. I covered basic mathematics skills for students in grade four and five. I also created a variety of colourful mascots; their purpose is to make the app more entertaining and fun. I worked on developing this project for two semesters in school.</p>

						<h3>Shaving Cream - Package Design</h3>
						<p>I created three different packaging designs for shaving cream using patterns and vector graphics, each design was different, the first one was a combination shaving cream designed for men and women, the second was designed for women, and the third was designed for men. The name of the product was randomly generated.</p>

						<h3>Calendar - Poster</h3>
						<p>I created a calendar for the twelve months of the year, focusing on designing within a grid, using a unique layout, with a maximum of two typefaces, a serif font, and a sansserif font. I used Futura to display the months and numbers, and ITC Galliard Std for the days of the week.</p>
